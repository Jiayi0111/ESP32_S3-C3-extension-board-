## 📚 How to Implement Voice Wake‑Up with ESP‑SKAINet 
In this guide, you’ll learn how to set up a voice wake‑up system on your ESP32 S3 using Espressif’s **ESP‑SKAINet**—a lightweight, deep‑learning‑based keyword spotting engine—and the **INMP441** I2S digital microphone. Your device will continuously listen for a predefined wake‑up word and trigger an event when it’s detected.

### 🧠 What Is Voice Wake‑Up with ESP‑SKAINet?

Voice wake‑up enables your device to remain in a low‑power state until it hears a specific keyword. ESP‑SKAINet utilizes a pre‑trained neural network model for real‑time keyword spotting. When the INMP441 captures audio through its I2S interface, the ESP‑SKAINet engine analyzes the data and triggers a callback function when it detects the wake‑up word.

*Example Callback:*
```c
// Called when the wake‑up word is detected
void wakeup_callback(void)
{
    printf("Wake‑up keyword detected!\n");
    // Insert actions to execute after wake‑up (e.g., start Wi‑Fi, read sensors)
}
```

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Clone and Set Up ESP‑SKAINet

**Steps:**

1. **Open a Terminal:**  
   Run the following command to clone the ESP‑SKAINet repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/espressif/esp-skainet.git
   ```
2. **Follow Repository Instructions:**  
   Refer to the repository’s README for specific setup and build instructions using ESP‑IDF. This may include installing prerequisites, configuring paths, and building the project.

---

### 2. Wire the INMP441 to the ESP32 S3

**Hardware Connections:**

- **Power:**
  - **VDD:** Connect to the ESP32 S3’s 3.3V output.
  - **GND:** Connect to the ESP32 S3’s GND.

- **I2S Data Interface:**
  - **BCK (Bit Clock):** e.g., GPIO 26  
  - **WS (Word Select / LRCLK):** e.g., GPIO 25  
  - **SD (Serial Data):** e.g., GPIO 35  
  - **LR (Left/Right Select):** Refer to your module’s documentation (often tied to GND).

> **Note:** Verify your ESP32 S3 board’s pinout. The chosen GPIOs should be free and suitable for I2S communication.

### 3. Configure I2S and Initialize ESP‑SKAINet in Code 
[ESP-Skainet (click to see example code)](https://github.com/espressif/esp-skainet)

Below is a sample ESP‑IDF style code that sets up the I2S driver, initializes the ESP‑SKAINet engine, and registers the wake‑up callback.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "freertos/FreeRTOS.h"
#include "freertos/task.h"
#include "driver/i2s.h"
#include "skainet.h"  // Include ESP‑SKAINet header

// Callback function for wake‑up event
void wakeup_callback(void)
{
    printf("Wake‑up keyword detected!\n");
    // Add custom actions: e.g., enabling peripherals, starting sensor routines
}

void app_main(void)
{
    // Configure I2S for the INMP441 microphone
    i2s_config_t i2s_config = {
        .mode = I2S_MODE_MASTER | I2S_MODE_RX,
        .sample_rate = 16000,
        .bits_per_sample = I2S_BITS_PER_SAMPLE_16BIT,
        .channel_format = I2S_CHANNEL_FMT_ONLY_LEFT, // INMP441 outputs mono audio
        .communication_format = I2S_COMM_FORMAT_I2S,
        .intr_alloc_flags = 0,
        .dma_buf_count = 8,
        .dma_buf_len = 64,
        .use_apll = false
    };

    i2s_pin_config_t pin_config = {
        .bck_io_num = 26,       // Bit Clock pin
        .ws_io_num = 25,        // Word Select (LRCLK) pin
        .data_out_num = I2S_PIN_NO_CHANGE, // Not used for input-only microphones
        .data_in_num = 35       // Serial Data pin
    };

    // Install I2S driver and assign pins
    i2s_driver_install(I2S_NUM_0, &i2s_config, 0, NULL);
    i2s_set_pin(I2S_NUM_0, &pin_config);

    // Initialize ESP‑SKAINet engine and register the wake‑up callback
    skainet_init();
    skainet_register_callback(wakeup_callback);

    printf("ESP‑SKAINet voice wake‑up is active on ESP32 S3.\n");
    printf("Say the wake‑up word to trigger the event.\n");

    // Main loop: continuously process audio data
    while (1) {
        skainet_process();  // Processes I2S audio frames and checks for the keyword
        vTaskDelay(pdMS_TO_TICKS(10));  // Short delay for task scheduling
    }
}
```

**Key Points:**
- **I2S Initialization:**  
  The configuration parameters (sample rate, bits per sample, and buffer sizes) are set to values compatible with the INMP441.
- **ESP‑SKAINet Initialization:**  
  The `skainet_init()` function loads the neural network model, and `skainet_register_callback()` sets the function to execute upon detecting the wake‑up word.
- **Continuous Processing:**  
  The main loop calls `skainet_process()` repeatedly, ensuring continuous audio analysis.

### 4. Testing and Calibration

**Testing Your Setup:**
- **Serial Monitor:**  
  Connect your ESP32 S3 to your computer and open a serial monitor. When you speak the wake‑up word, you should see the message:  
  `Wake‑up keyword detected!`

- **Adjust Sensitivity:**  
  Depending on your environment and microphone sensitivity, you may need to tweak the ESP‑SKAINet settings or even the audio pre‑processing parameters. Check the ESP‑SKAINet documentation for guidance on tuning model parameters.

- **Verify Connections:**  
  Ensure all wiring is secure and the correct GPIOs are used. Loose connections or misconfigured pins can prevent proper operation.

---

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **No Wake‑Up Detected:**
  - **Double-check Wiring:** Confirm the INMP441 connections match the pin configuration in your code.
  - **Check I2S Settings:** Ensure the sample rate and buffer sizes are set correctly for your microphone.
  - **Model Calibration:** Your environment may require adjustments in the model’s sensitivity—consult the ESP‑SKAINet documentation for fine‑tuning options.

- **ESP‑SKAINet Initialization Issues:**
  - Verify that all dependencies and libraries required by ESP‑SKAINet are correctly installed.
  - Ensure your ESP‑IDF version is compatible with the ESP‑SKAINet project.

- **Serial Output Issues:**
  - Confirm that the baud rate in your code (e.g., `115200`) matches your serial monitor settings.
  - Insert additional debug prints if necessary to isolate where the process may be stalling.

## 📁 Additional Tips and Advanced Considerations

- **Integrate Low‑Power Techniques:**  
  Since continuous audio processing may increase power consumption, consider using a secondary, low‑power sensor to trigger the ESP‑SKAINet processing when minimal activity is detected.

- **Expanding Functionality:**  
  The wake‑up callback can be extended to perform tasks such as:
  - Enabling Wi‑Fi connectivity.
  - Activating sensor measurements.
  - Displaying information on an attached screen.

- **Further Customization:**  
  Explore additional configurations in ESP‑SKAINet:
  - **Model Updates:** Experiment with different pre‑trained models or even train your own for customized keyword spotting.
  - **Parameter Tuning:** Adjust the audio pre‑processing steps (such as filtering or normalization) to improve detection accuracy in noisy environments.

- **Combining with Other Projects:**  
  Use the wake‑up trigger as a starting point for larger IoT projects, such as home automation, where the ESP32 S3 activates specific functions only when needed.
