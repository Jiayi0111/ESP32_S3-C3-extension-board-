In the **hello_world** project, there are a few files that are not necessary for compilation and execution.

---

### **1️⃣ Removing Unnecessary Files**  
The following two files are used for **pytest testing framework**, but they are not needed in this tutorial:  
❌ `sdkconfig.ci`  
❌ `pytest_hello_world.py`  

📝 **These files do not affect compilation or execution**, so you can safely delete them.  

For those interested in **pytest for ESP-IDF**, refer to the official guide:  
📖 [[ESP-IDF Pytest Guide - ESP32-S3](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/)](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/)  

Additionally, the `README.md` file is just a **project description** and is not involved in the compilation or execution process.

---

### **2️⃣ Minimum Project Structure**  

After removing the unnecessary files, the **essential project structure** consists of:  

📂 **main/** → Contains source code and CMake build configuration.  
📄 **main.c** → The **main source file**.  
📄 **CMakeLists.txt** (inside `main/`) → **Component-level** build settings.  
📄 **CMakeLists.txt** (project-level, same directory as `main/`) → **Project-level** build settings.  

---

### **3️⃣ Understanding `CMakeLists.txt` Files**  

#### **(A) Project-Level `CMakeLists.txt`**  
Located in the **root directory** of the project (same level as `main/`).  
Click on this file to view its contents:

```cmake
# The following lines of boilerplate have to be in your project's
# CMakeLists in this exact order for cmake to work correctly
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.16)

include($ENV{IDF_PATH}/tools/cmake/project.cmake)
project(hello_world)
```

📌 **Breakdown of this file**:  
- **Line 3:** Specifies the **minimum required CMake version** (`3.16`).  
  - ESP32 projects use **CMake** as the build system.  
  - CMake is a cross-platform build tool that **automates compilation**.  
  - **You don’t need to deeply understand CMake**—just follow the tutorial and modify configurations as needed.  
- **Line 5:** Includes the **ESP-IDF project configuration file**.  
- **Line 6:** Defines the **project name** (`hello_world`).  
  - This name **determines the compiled binary file name**.  
  - Example: If the project name is `hello_world`, the compiled output will be `hello_world.bin`.  
  - If you rename it to `project(xxx)`, the output file will be `xxx.bin`.

#### **(B) Component-Level `CMakeLists.txt` (Inside `main/`)**  
Located inside the `main/` directory.  
Click on this file to view its contents:

```cmake
idf_component_register(SRCS "hello_world_main.c"
                    INCLUDE_DIRS "")
```

📌 **Breakdown of this file**:  
- This file **registers source files** for the ESP-IDF build system.  
- The `SRCS` parameter lists all **source files** to compile.  
  - Since this project has only **one `.c` file**, only `hello_world_main.c` is listed.  
- If you create a **new C file**, you must **add it here**.  
  - In most cases, **ESP-IDF automatically updates this file** when you add new `.c` files.  
  - If not, manually add the filename.

### **4️⃣ Program Execution Overview**  

💡 The `hello_world` project **prints "Hello World" to the serial terminal** and **restarts every 10 seconds**.
