## üîß Overview of Xiaozhi Framework

The **Xiaozhi system** is an intelligent, voice-interactive framework designed for embedded devices like the ESP32-S3. It supports real-time communication with cloud services, natural language understanding, and interactive UI output. Its architecture is modular and object-oriented, enabling high portability across hardware platforms.

### üîπ Key Architecture Components

* **Audio Capture and Playback**
  Utilizes the ESP32-S3‚Äôs I2S interface to stream audio from microphones and to speakers in real time.

* **WebSocket-Based Communication**
  Uses a hybrid JSON and binary protocol for STT (Speech-to-Text), TTS (Text-to-Speech), and device command handling.

* **Object-Oriented Server Integration**
  Each device is treated as an instance of a class on the cloud, inheriting from a shared base class to streamline code reuse and scalability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Porting Xiaozhi to Our Extension Board

To integrate Xiaozhi into our custom ESP32 extension board, several adaptations were made:

### üéß Audio Subsystem

* Reworked the **audio driver layer** to support our specific codec chip and I2S configuration.
* The abstract audio interface remained unchanged, highlighting the benefit of Xiaozhi's layered architecture.

### üì∫ LCD and UI Output

* Adapted display routines to use **ESP-IDF-compatible libraries** for our LCD driver.
* Maintained the abstract UI layer without significant structural changes.

## üöß Challenges & Solutions

| Issue                    | Description                                    | Solution                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Codec incompatibility    | Opus encoding errors from sample rate mismatch | Reconfigured I2S + encoder to 16kHz mono                |
| LCD driver mismatch      | Default driver unsupported for our screen      | Rewrote SPI display driver using ESP-IDF display libs   |
| GPIO pin conflict        | Shared pins between LED and other functions    | Resolved via updated pin remapping in board definitions |
| WebSocket handshake fail | Token not accepted by server                   | Corrected `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header format |
