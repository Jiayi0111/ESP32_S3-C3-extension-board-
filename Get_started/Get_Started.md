## üåü What is ESP32?

The ESP32 is a powerful and versatile microcontroller developed by Espressif Systems, designed specifically for IoT (Internet of Things) applications. It integrates both **Wi-Fi** and **Bluetooth (classic and BLE)** connectivity, making it ideal for smart devices, home automation, wearable technology, and countless DIY electronics projects.

## üîé ESP32 Development Board Overview

A typical ESP32 development board consists of several key components:
![alt text](image.png)
1. **Micro USB Port:**  
   Supplies power to the board (usually 5V) and allows you to upload programs directly from your computer.

2. **Reset Button (RST):**  
   Quickly restart your ESP32 board, helpful during troubleshooting or after uploading new code.

3. **BOOT Button (IO0):**  
   Used to put the board into firmware upload mode (bootloader) when held during startup, enabling you to flash new software onto the ESP32.

4. **ESP32-WROOM-32 Module:**  
   The heart of the development board, containing the ESP32 chip, flash memory, and antenna, responsible for wireless communication and general processing tasks.

5. **GPIO Pins (General Purpose Input Output):**  
   Programmable pins allowing your ESP32 to interface with external devices like sensors, actuators, LEDs, motors, relays, and more.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Pin Limitations and Solutions

The ESP32 chip has 48 pins, 34 of which are programmable GPIO pins. Each GPIO pin supports multiple functionalities (known as pin multiplexing), but only one function can be activated at a time‚Äîsuch as GPIO, ADC, UART, etc. However, not all ESP32 development boards expose all available pins, and some pins are reserved for internal purposes or have specific restrictions, limiting their usability in certain projects.

To address these limitations, our specially designed extension boards significantly enhance ESP32's capabilities by providing additional GPIO pins and dedicated ports for multiple I2C, SPI, UART interfaces. This resolves common issues like pin shortages and difficulties using multiple I2C devices simultaneously, greatly simplifying and expanding the possibilities for your advanced ESP32 projects.
