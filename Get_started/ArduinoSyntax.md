# Understanding Arduino Syntax

Arduino is based on **C++**, and before jumping into projects, it’s important to get familiar with its **syntax** and how to use it effectively. Let’s walk through the essentials in a way that’s easy to understand.

## 💬 Comments

When writing code, **comments** are super important. They don’t affect how your code runs, but they help you (and others) understand what the code is doing. Think of them as notes to your future self—or anyone else reading your code.

In Arduino (and C++), there are two types of comments:

- **Single-line comments**: Start with `//`
- **Multi-line comments**: Wrap the text with `/*` and `*/`

**Examples:**
```cpp
// This is a single-line comment

/*
This is a multi-line comment
It can span across multiple lines
*/
```

Use comments to explain:
- What a function does
- What parameters mean
- What a block of code is intended to do
- Any limitations or assumptions
- Author info, dates, and version notes

💡 *Good comments are clear, concise, and always updated to reflect any code changes!*

## 🔤 Variables

In programming, **variables** store information—like numbers, letters, or true/false values.

In Arduino, you **declare** a variable before using it:
```cpp
type variableName;
```

### Common Data Types:
- `int`: Integer (whole numbers), takes 2 bytes, range: -32,768 to 32,767
- `float`: Floating-point number (decimals), takes 4 bytes
- `char`: Single character (e.g., 'A'), 1 byte
- `bool`: Boolean value—either `true` or `false`

**Examples:**
```cpp
int a;
float b = 3.14;
char c = 'A';
bool d = true;
```

You can **change a variable’s value** later:
```cpp
int a = 10;
a = 20;  // Now a is 20
```

Arduino also supports `String`, arrays, and other advanced types. Choose the type that suits your needs to avoid wasting memory.

## 🔀 Conditional Statements

Sometimes, you want your code to **make decisions**. That’s where conditionals come in.

### `if` Statements
Use `if` to run code only when a condition is true:
```cpp
if (condition) {
  // Code runs if condition is true
}
```

Add an `else` for when the condition is false:
```cpp
if (condition) {
  // Runs if true
} else {
  // Runs if false
}
```

Chain multiple conditions with `else if`:
```cpp
if (condition1) {
  // First condition
} else if (condition2) {
  // Second condition
} else {
  // Neither condition met
}
```

### `switch` Statements
`switch` is great when checking one variable against many values:
```cpp
switch (variable) {
  case value1:
    // Code for value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // Code for value2
    break;
  default:
    // If none match
    break;
}
```

Always include `break;` to avoid "fall-through" (accidentally running other cases too).

## 🔁 Loops

Need to repeat something? Loops are your best friend.

### `for` Loop
Great when you **know** how many times to repeat:
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  Serial.println(i);
}
```

This prints numbers 0 to 9. Here’s what happens:
- Initialize: `int i = 0`
- Check: Is `i < 10`?
- If yes: run code, then `i++` (add 1)
- Repeat

### `while` Loop
Use when you **don’t know** how many times you’ll need to repeat:
```cpp
int i = 0;
while (i < 10) {
  Serial.println(i);
  i++;
}
```

This does the same as the `for` loop above—just with a different structure.

## 📦 Arrays

An **array** lets you store multiple values in one variable.

### Declare an array:
```cpp
int myArray[5];  // An array of 5 integers
```

### Initialize an array:
```cpp
int myArray[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
// or
int myArray[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
```

### Access array elements:
```cpp
int x = myArray[2];  // x = 3
```

### Loop through an array:
```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  Serial.println(myArray[i]);
}
```

### Multidimensional Arrays:
```cpp
int matrix[3][3] = {
  {1, 2, 3},
  {4, 5, 6},
  {7, 8, 9}
};

int x = matrix[1][2];  // x = 6
```

## 🛠️ Functions

Functions are **mini-programs** that do a specific task. They help keep code organized and reusable.

### Example function with parameters and return value:
```cpp
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}

int result = add(3, 5);  // result = 8
```

### Function with no return value (a `void` function):
```cpp
void sayHello() {
  Serial.println("Hello World!");
}
```

Functions = clean, reusable, and maintainable code.

## 🔧 Commonly Used Arduino Functions

Here are some built-in Arduino functions you’ll use a lot:

| Function | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `pinMode(pin, mode)` | Set pin as input or output |
| `digitalWrite(pin, value)` | Set digital pin HIGH or LOW |
| `digitalRead(pin)` | Read digital pin value |
| `analogRead(pin)` | Read analog pin value (0-1023) |
| `analogWrite(pin, value)` | Output PWM (0-255) on certain pins |
| `delay(ms)` | Pause for a given number of milliseconds |
| `millis()` | Get time since program started (in ms) |
| `Serial.begin(baud)` | Start serial communication |
| `Serial.print(data)` | Print data to serial monitor |
| `Serial.available()` | Check if data is ready to be read |

## 💡 Example: Blinking an LED

```cpp
int led_pin = 2;

void setup() {
  pinMode(led_pin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(led_pin, HIGH); // Turn LED on
  delay(1000);                 // Wait 1 second
  digitalWrite(led_pin, LOW);  // Turn LED off
  delay(1000);                 // Wait 1 second
}
```

This simple sketch makes an LED blink on and off every second.
